# Whitelist of Popular Search Engines

Whitelist of known good crawlers from search engines that are not malicious. It is updated when new IP ranges are found hitting the https://www.bestbytes.com web server.

The format is suited to NGINX server format by nature, but the list should be easy enough to modify with a script for the average programmer.
