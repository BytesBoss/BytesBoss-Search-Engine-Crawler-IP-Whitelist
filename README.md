# Whitelist of Popular Search Engines

I notice hardly anyone does correctly search engine white lists while a good deal of people seem to request and be after them. On my websites I have created a list that flags all known search engine crawlers agents and verifies them with "whois" script to make sure they are not fake. I am happy to share this list, it can also be used in opposite if you want to ban these as well.

The SEO list is automatically compiled to suit nginx web servers but can easily be modified to suite whatever you need. This list will be worked on in future and is just only started, as I find more legit ranges they will be added straight away.
